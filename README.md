# FTG: freeCodeCamp TOC Generator

I like TOC and headings with anchors, especially for technical articles. However, freeCodeCamp's blog doesn't have built-in support for this at the time of making it (2022 July). This site's goal is to help freeCodeCamp writers to make it possible with less hassle.
